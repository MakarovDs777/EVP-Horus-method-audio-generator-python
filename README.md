# Broken-audio-sound-generator-python-(Version-1)

And in short, such a bombastic idea came to my mind. I don't know if I'm the first to do this on the planet, but figure out what it would be like to take a video and break up a mosaic of bits in the video, and in short, assemble these bits back into the video by randomly mixing them together like mosaics, and how such a generator would turn out. random broken videos... And in short, I wrote this code, but it doesn't work with all videos, but it works fine with audio.

# Broken-audio-sound-generator-python-(Version-2)

Here is the second version, which is good in its own way... Only some sequences are half mixed, and some are not mixed and then mixed together in audio, but it does not work with video.
